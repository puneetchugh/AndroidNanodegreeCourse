#MovieOut Android App

The MovieOut Android App displays movies baesed on either popularirty or rating. The user gets these two options when he pulls a drawer from the left and he choses one of the two options of sorting by popularity or rating. When the user further clicks on the movie-poster, he's taken to another page that displays more information about the movie like user-rating, release-date and overview.

#Technical Aspects

This app uses Android SDK 22. The app uses navigation drawer to present options to the user on how to sort and display the movies. The user is presented with 2 options. Those two options are opened in different fragments.

The app also uses Material Design feature like Recycler View. Recycler view is used to display the movie posters using Grid Layout. The benefit of using Recycler View other than being space efficient is that one can use any layout be it GridLayout, LinearLayout, etc.
